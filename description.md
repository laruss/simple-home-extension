Simple Home Page transforms your new tab into a clean, distraction-free workspace.

**SEARCH YOUR WAY**
Choose from 5 search engines - Google, Bing, Perplexity, Yandex, or Baidu. Switch instantly with one click or keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + G/B/P/Y/X). Your preference syncs across all your devices.

**SMART NAVIGATION**
Type a search query or enter a URL directly. Simple Home Page automatically detects websites (like "github.com") and takes you there without an extra search step.

**QUICK ACCESS BOOKMARKS**
Add your favorite sites with automatic title and favicon fetching, plus optional custom icon uploads. Organize them with drag controls, delete what you don't need, and resize to your preference (small, medium, or large). Bookmarks are stored locally.

**SYNCED SETTINGS**
Your search engine choice syncs across all Chrome browsers where you're signed in.

**MINIMAL & FAST**
No clutter. No distractions. Just a beautiful background, your search bar, and your bookmarks. Loads instantly every time you open a new tab.

**PRIVACY FRIENDLY**
We don't track you. The only permission we need is to fetch website info when you add bookmarks.

## Privacy Justification

This extension requires host permissions solely to fetch website metadata (page title and favicon) when users add bookmarks. No browsing data is collected, stored remotely, or shared. All data remains in Chrome's local/sync storage.
